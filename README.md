# MetaCoin-goes-to-Harmony  
  
Part of my #100daysofcode venture, focusing on Solidity and the Harmony protocol  
  
Planning to grow the default MetaCoin project into an experimental smart contract including a range of mechanics. Purely fun and free knowledge. Probably won't be production ready but I'll work on it.  
  
Day 2, MetaCoin became NewbCoin to reflect my newb status of Solidity and blockchain development.
