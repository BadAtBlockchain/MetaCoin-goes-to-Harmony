# MetaCoin-goes-to-Harmony  
  
Part of my #100daysofcode venture, focusing on Solidity and the Harmony protocol  
  
Planning to grow this default MetaCoin project into an experimental smart contract including a range of mechanics. Purely fun and free knowledge. Probably won't be production ready but I'll work on it.
